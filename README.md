This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to type checking and the `IsNumeric` function. The `bug.vbs` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  This is a common issue when dealing with loose typing in VBScript, so it is essential to understand how to reliably check data types and handle errors.
